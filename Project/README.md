# ITU ACM 2018 - Android Programming Study Group - Project

We thought that it will be awesome if you create your own project with the knowledge given in the courses. Therefore, we encourage you to write your own code and create a project about a thing you like.

## What will the project look like?

We will create something like Daily... . Everyone will choose a topic from their interests and will make DailySometing App. The application will show something to users about the topic chosen by the creator. We will show different things every day so that users will want to open the app more often.
DailySometing will also provide users to archive and chat about that topic.  

## How will we progress?

Every week we will provide tasks for you to add features to the application. This tasks will be about the topic that we have covered in that week's lecture. At the end of the week, we will upload documentation about how did we add that features.  

## All projects

After creating your repository, copy the link of it down here so that, we will have a bunch of cool applications
Note that we will provide tasks and documentation just to help you with creating a project. It will be something like cheatsheet.
You can create a completely different app with completely different features. But if you follow your way, please also share them below.
