# ITU ACM 2018 - Android Programming Study Group - Project - Week 1

It is the first week of the project so firstly we should decide what will be about. After finding a cool thing to work with, we will create the project and implement an API.

Here is the complete list of thing to do:

1. Find a topic that you have interested in.
2. Create a repository on GitHub.
3. Create a project from Android Studio by using clone feature.
4. Implement Http get method to get a response from API.
5. Parse the response using Gson our your own custom parser functions.

Some important notes:

* Find a topic which has an API about it. Otherwise, we cannot create the app.
* Be aware of the limitations of the API you are using. Some of the APIs have a limited number of requests.
* Before parsing the response, know all possible responses and their structures and parse the response to right object so your app will not crash.
