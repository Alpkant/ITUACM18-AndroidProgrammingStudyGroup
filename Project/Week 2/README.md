# ITU ACM 2018 - Android Programming Study Group
## Project - Week 2

Here is the second week of the project. Until now if you do the tasks of first week, then you have an application which can send requsts to API and parses the results using JSON parser methods.

It is time for us to make the application more beatiful. Meaning that we will work with XMLs and Layouts.

Here is the complete list of things to do:

1. Create a layout and a fragment for the homepage where information about the topic will shown. (A Film for our project)
2. Create a layout and a fragment for the archived items. This fragment will have a RecylerView on which archived items will shown.
3. Crete a layout and a fragment for the chat page. Also, this fragment  will have a RecylerView on which chat items will shown.


Some important notes:

* Try to use res/values efficiently. Add your colors, strings, styles here.
* Use placeholders for message items and archived items. But use real responses for homepage.
* For the 3rd tasks, there must be two different chat item. One for received and another for sent messages.
